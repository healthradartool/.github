## Responsible Access to Data for Analysis and Research

Health RADAR makes it easier to find and use data for climate sensitive infectious disease (CSID) modelling. The platform collates a wide range of data sources—including demographic, epidemiological, entomological, climate and environmental, health system, intervention impact and cost data—relevant to CSID modelling. While the data are not available for download on our site, Health RADAR guides you through downloading the data on partner websites. In addition, Health RADAR provides extensive documentation that describes and contextualises each dataset and offers worked code examples on how to incorporate data into CSID models.
